          Throughout my life, I have had the opportunity to learn about a wide
          variety of topics, each with its own richness and depth. However, if I
          am completely honest, there is one lesson that has become a
          fundamental pillar in my daily life, thats the self-love.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a long time, I prioritized others over my own needs, even when it
          meant hurting myself or putting myself in second place. I believed
          that putting myself last was a sign of generosity, but over time, I
          realized that there is no greater act of generosity than loving
          ourselves first.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned, sometimes through pain, that true fulfillment does not come
          from external validation but yes from the relationship we build with
          ourselves. It's not about selfishness, it's about recognizing that
          only when we are well with ourselves can we offer the best of us to
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I came to the conclusion that the most important thing in life is to
          listen to ourselves with honesty and courage, dare to do what we truly
          desire with every fiber of our being. It is not about following
          other's expectations but about living in armony with our own essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          And above all, I understood something crucial. If we are not there for
          ourselves, no one else will be. The most important person in our lives
          is ourselves, and learning to take care of, respect, and love
          ourselves is the greatest gift we can give.
