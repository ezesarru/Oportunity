          It's the book that's transforming me. It explores about the path to
          spiritual realization and the journey of self-discovery.

          The power of now is more than just a simple book. It makes you aware
          that each moment of your life its a miracle, whether we realize it or
          not.

          One of the things I appreciate most about this book is that its author
          is not aligned with any particular religion or doctrine. His teachings
          come from the heart, drawing from the essence of various traditions,
          yet without contradicting any of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Show us, with simple and clear language, that the way, the truth and
          the light are within us.

        <p>As i continue reading, I will gradually expand this section.</p>
